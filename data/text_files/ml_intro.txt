Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. 
It involves training algorithms on historical data to make predictions or decisions. 
ML techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
Applications of ML are widespread, including image recognition, natural language processing, 
recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.

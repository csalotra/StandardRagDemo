RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It combines information retrieval 
with a language model. The retriever fetches relevant documents from a database or corpus, 
and the language model generates answers based on the retrieved documents. 
RAG helps reduce hallucinations in generated content and is widely used in chatbots, 
Q&A systems, and knowledge assistants.
